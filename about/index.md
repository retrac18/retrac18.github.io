## About

Hi, I'm Carter [kahr-ter], welcome to my blog.  This blog is an expression of creativity, inspiration, and patience.

Now a little bit about me... I am a thirty-something old idea-machine and living in the central part of the Philippines, one of the progressive cities in our country, <b>CEBU</b>.  I am a Software Engineer by profession.

I'm currently affiliated with [SmartStart Inc](https://www.smartstart.us){:target="_blank"}.  I love my job, love the people whom I worked with, love everything about the company <em>(the perks, boss, work schedule, etc.)</em>.

I am basically the jack of all trades kind of guy.  I'm into photography, music, mountain biking, traveling to other countries and local cities and sports.  Also loves to eat any food as long as I'm not allergic to it. ^_^

If you want to contact me, feel free to message below or connect with me in one of the social links here.
