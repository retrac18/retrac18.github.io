Last long weekend, my friends and I were having a summer getaway in the province of Badian, Cebu Philippines.  This photo was taken in the Terra Manna Resort where we have stayed for 3 days and 2 nights.  The summer getaway was a blast, we had so much fun.

One cold night, I wasn't feeling asleep at that time so I grab my camera and was looking for a something to shoot.  As I was walking in the middle of the night, I found this cottage house that was not used, I set up my tripod and camera and compose a shot to include the coconut tree.  Notice that the leaves of the tree are blurry, it's because of the wind.  It added a nice effect to the photo.

I took a long exposure shot with camera sets to 35mm, ISO 100 and 30 sec shutter speed and this is the result.  Just a little tweak in Lightroom to adjust the white balance and the colors.

I like the result and enjoyed looking for something to shoot in the cold silent night.

Hope you like it.
