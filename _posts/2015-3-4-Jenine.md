A black & white portrait of Ms. Jenine.  A late afternoon photoshoot in North Reclamation Area in Cebu.  This Photo was taken a few years ago with my Clickerbug group.

This photo was a reminder of my early days in the field of photography specially for Portrait session.

Had a fun time with her families and friends who help during the session.
