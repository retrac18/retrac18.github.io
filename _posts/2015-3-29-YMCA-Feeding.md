---

Yesterday, the company that I work with is sponsoring a feeding program here in Cebu City conducted by Cebu YMCA. They called it "LILY" project a health and hunger project.  LILY means Lugaw Init Libre sa YMCA.  This is a continuing program Cebu YMCA every Saturday and Sunday 7:00- 9:00 am.

LILY project is open to everybody, akin to "Soup Kitchen", anybody who likes to eat HOT porridge is welcomed.  Our company added some hotdogs, bread(pandesal) and boiled eggs for the breakfast.

Had a fun time taking photos of children and the young at heart enjoying the free meal.
