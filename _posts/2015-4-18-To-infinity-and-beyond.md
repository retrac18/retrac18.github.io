That is my boss, during our summer party last April 18, 2015 on our way to the Pandanon Island of Bohol, Philippines.  In the mid-way of our trip he choose to sit in the front edge of the boat that we are riding.  So I grab my camera and took the shot of him with the nice sea view heading to the island.  It looks a little scary but only at first, you'll get a hang of it when you've tried it.  We'll YOLO (you only live once), so take a chance to try new things.

This shot was capture using a Tamron SP AF 17-50mm and Canon 60D.
