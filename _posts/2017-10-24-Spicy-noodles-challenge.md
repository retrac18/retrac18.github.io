title: Spicy Noodles Challege!
---

A little note to all, I really love spicy foods.  So when my officemates decided to have a spicy noodles challenge, I instantly said <em>"Game on!"</em>.  We scheduled it during the visit of one of our US colleague from Utah Office who also loves spicy foods. And decided that we video record our challenge, for documentary purposes. ^_^

Most of us haven't tried the noodles were about to eat.  And it was trending the interwebs about eating that spicy noodles.  The instant spicy noodles are called Samyang 2x Spicy, it's the one with the red plastic.  I think this instant noodle comes from Korea, because they also love spicy foods.  

Without further ado, watch the video below for our Samyang Spicy Noodles Challenge.
