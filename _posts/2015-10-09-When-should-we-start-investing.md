title: When should we start investing?
---

Well, I don't think there is an exact or perfect age to start investing.  Even when we are children we've started investing in ourselves by studying in schools.  We are never too young or old to start investing.

Investing is, in many ways, like learning a second language.  It's easier and more rewarding if we started when we're young.  Like when I used to save coins in my piggy bank at the start of the year and collect it by the end of the year.  I've been fascinated with the concept of storing something away with the hope that its value will grow over time.

I think that a good time to begin investing is when you start your first "real" job.  Like a job that supports you and your family.

We could start investing by taking care of our immediate cash needs.  Most financial books or experts suggest saving an emergency fund of three to six months' worth of expenses before anything long-term that we wouldn't want to have to cash in unexpectedly.

I've started late in financial investing because no one gives an advice on how to manage my finances.  When we're young we really don't care where most of our money goes.

If our emergency fund and retirement fund are taken care of and still have extra money to invest.  Then we could start small amounts like 2 to 5 percents of our monthly income.  So if you're reading this, give it a thought and start planning on investing your extra money to make it double or more.

Start slow and spend a lot of time learning, and you could find investing an interesting and profitable hobby--or perhaps a career path.
