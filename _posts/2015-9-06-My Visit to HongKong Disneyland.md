My friends and I decided to have a trip to HongKong.  This country offers lots of delicious foods, amazing places, and amazing amusement parks.  One of which I didn't let pass is to visit Disneyland.

We couldn't watch all the theater shows, ride all the rides available even spending the entire day there.  There are lots of scheduled shows that time one of which we watched is the Lion King and it was fantastically amazing.  We've ridden lots of the rides there and one of my favorites is the Space Mountain.  It's a roller coaster with a basic wild mouse coaster in the dark.  It will give you a walk through the spaceport, the blast-off into space, the on-ride music, the ride through the star field.  It's made me wow and enjoy every bit of the ride.

There are lots of stores inside the park, which offers everything you could imagine of course with a Disneyland image on it.  From simple keychains to pillows, shirts, bags, hats, Disney character figurines, etc.

We ended the day in HongKong Disneyland with a parade of some famous Disney characters and a 30 minutes' wonderful fireworks display in the famous Disney castle.

The experience while you're there is simply amazingly magical.  I was like a kid again enjoying everything I see.  It's worth to visit Disneyland while you are in Hong Kong.
