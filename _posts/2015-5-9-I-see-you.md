During my visit to Davao City, south of the 	Philippines, I got a chance of visiting an interesting farm, the Davao Crocodile Park, the city's answer to a "zoo".  This recreational park is home to a variety of animals, it even has a tiger.  I took a shot of this Ostrich while they are keeping cool under a tree against the heat of the sun.

I will be posting some of my photo's of the beautiful creatures I've took during my visit at the Crocodile Park.  Hopefully I can return there again and enjoy seeing the wonderful creatures.
