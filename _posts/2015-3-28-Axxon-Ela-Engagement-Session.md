title: Axxon & Rowela Engagement Session
---

This is one of the my favorite photo taken during the engagement session with Axxon and Rowela.  I love the way this couple got so candid with me in front of my lens after they loosened up. They are soo adorable. As you can see!  I spent the whole day with Axxon and Rowela for their engagement photoshoot. Axxon is a friend and colleague at work.

This photo was taken at the roof deck of the building where we work at.  We've gone to beautiful spots here in Cebu for their engagement session like Temple of Leah in Busay and the Marcelo Fernan Bridge in Mactan.

We made it through the day with the help of our friends for the preparations and props for the engagement session.

Congratulations Rowela and Axxon!  They will be married this coming May 8.
