title: Sunset by the beach
---

I have a chance to shoot a sunset by the beach during my last vacation.  I grab my tripod and camera to setup a sunset shot.  It was nice because it is low tide and I have a rock as a foreground for my sunset shot.  I set my camera settings to ISO 100, the aperture to f16, with the lens set to a 35mm wide and tried multiple shots with 1sec to 5secs shutter speed.

The result was perfectly fine and I love it.  Hoping to shoot more sunsets in the near future.
