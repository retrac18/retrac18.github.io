title: Wedding Rings
---

This photo was taken using a Canon EF 50mm II Lens.  The area where the groom, the bride and the entourage was preparing before the event has a little bit of space to shoot.  So I was looking for a better place where to shoot the wedding rings of the couple.  Preparing for the shot, we use a glass table with a yellow light underneath it to get the warmth and gold effect.  And also use the brides bouquet of flowers as background for the rings.

I have set my camera settings to f1.8, ISO 125 with a 1/125 shutter speed.  I am happy with what the result of this shot, the nifty fifty lens of Canon saves my life here given with a tight space during the photoshoot.
