title: Christmas is here!
---

As the song by Andy Williams entitled <em>It's the most wonderful time of the year</em>.  Yup, Christmas is here, the joyful and wonderful season of the year.  You can see, feel and hear it in every corner in our town.  Some started decorating or playing Christmas songs as early as September.

This is the time when children or choir groups sing joyful carols in their neighbor's house.  For some, it's the best time for family reunions or friends that are separated for a long time and meet again during this season to catch up.

It's also the time for the owners of shopping malls to make a Christmas sale on their products.  The stores/malls are full with shoppers buying gifts for their parents, sons, daughters, god-childrens and more.

This is the only holiday or season that I or maybe you feel in every person you've met are jolly and the hearts shining.  It is really indeed the most wonderful time of the year.  All I can hope is that every day is Christmas day where everyone is always sharing and laughing and having a good time.

To you who is reading this, I wish you a very Merry Christmas, may you and your family will be blessed with good health, happiness and good fortune today and the days to come.  Cheers!
