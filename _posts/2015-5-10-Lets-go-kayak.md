title: Lets go Kayak!
---

During my summer escapade with friends in the beautiful town of Badian, south of Cebu.  I have experienced Kayaking, even though the sun is hot, it didn't stop me and my friends enjoy the beach and kayaking through the beach.  We kayak from one beach shore to the other, I estimated it a 2 or 3 kilometers away from each other.  It was fun and the pain of the muscles brought by rowing was worth it when we reach the other beach.  It has a nice white sand and clear sea water.

I took this photo using my Canon 60D with the settings focal length to 17mm, shutter speed at 1/50 sec, Aperture at f22 and ISO 100.
