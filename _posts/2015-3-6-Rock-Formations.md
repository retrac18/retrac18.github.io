title: Rock Formations
---

Had a chance to go to Samar Island for a vacation with friends.  And found out this place in Biri Island of Samar, Philippines.  I took the photo of the wonderful rock formations facing the Pacific Ocean.  The heat and exhaustion was worth it after visiting this place.

Hoping to be back in there soon.
